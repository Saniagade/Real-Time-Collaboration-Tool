## üìå Introduction
In this project, we are developing a **real-time collaborative code editor** where multiple users can edit code simultaneously and see updates instantly.  
The application is built using **Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and CodeMirror**.  

The goal is to provide a **modern, responsive, browser-accessible platform** where users can write, edit, and view code in real-time without refreshing the page.  
This project replicates some features of advanced tools like **Google Docs** or online IDEs such as **CodeSandbox** and **Repl.it**, but in a simplified form.

## üéØ Objective
The main objective is to allow multiple users to connect to a **shared code editor** and collaborate efficiently.  
Any changes made by one user should instantly reflect in other users‚Äô browsers.  

This eliminates the need for repeatedly sending updated files manually and fosters **seamless teamwork**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Node.js** ‚Üí Backend runtime environment  
- **Express.js** ‚Üí Lightweight web framework for routes & serving files  
- **Socket.IO** ‚Üí Real-time, bi-directional communication between client & server  
- **CodeMirror** ‚Üí Browser-based code editor with syntax highlighting & formatting  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** ‚Üí Frontend structure, styling & scripting  

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-time Code Updates** ‚Üí Any changes made by one user are broadcast instantly to all connected clients using Socket.IO.  
- **Syntax Highlighting** ‚Üí Powered by CodeMirror for multiple programming languages.  
- **Multiple User Support** ‚Üí All connected users can type simultaneously and see updates in real-time.  
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility** ‚Üí Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and modern browsers.  
- **No ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù Required** ‚Üí Runs directly with `npm start`.  
- **Scalable Architecture** ‚Üí Can be deployed on **Heroku, Render, or Vercel**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. **Client Connection** ‚Üí User connects to server via Socket.IO.  
2. **Editor Initialization** ‚Üí CodeMirror loads with predefined settings.  
3. **Change Detection** ‚Üí Typing triggers change events sent to server.  
4. **Broadcasting Changes** ‚Üí Server broadcasts updates to all clients (except sender).  
5. **Real-time Updates** ‚Üí All connected clients see changes instantly.  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Steps to Run the Project Locally
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (if not already installed).  
2. Create a project folder and navigate into it.  
3. Initialize project & install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install express socket.io
4.Download CodeMirror or use a CDN in your HTML file.
5.Create server.js for backend code and public/index.html for frontend.

6.Start the server:
node server.js

7.Open the browser at:
http://localhost:3000

8.Open multiple tabs or devices to test real-time collaboration.

## Conclusion
The Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor successfully demonstrates how multiple users can work together on the same code in real-time. By leveraging Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and CodeMirror, the system provides instant synchronization, syntax highlighting, and a smooth collaborative experience directly in the browser.

This project highlights the power of WebSockets for real-time communication and showcases how collaborative platforms like online IDEs and document editors can be built from scratch.

It can be further enhanced by adding features such as:

User authentication and role management

Support for multiple programming languages

File storage and version control

Integrated chat for communication

Overall, the project serves as a solid foundation for building advanced collaborative coding environments that encourage teamwork, improve productivity, and reduce the friction of manual code sharing.
